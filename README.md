# VideoStreaming
Small Application for video streaming implemented using segments

##
1. POST /upload API can be used to upload mp4 videos which will be converted to segments and stored in uploads directly(ideally we can modify it to store those in S3 storage or blob container)
2. Change the video url in frontend code so that the correct video is played
